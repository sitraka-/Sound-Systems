> _(Designing)_ at the intersection of speculative fiction and [anthropology](https://www.discoveranthropology.org.uk/about-anthropology/what-is-anthropology.html), we find a sense of [epistemological humility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_humility) about the kind of worlds we could or should inhabit. Yet epistemological humility should not be confused with futility: possibilities and potentialities still matter. We do not know what we are capable of, and yet that need not keep us from the pursuit of [what ifs](https://dunneandraby.co.uk/content/bydandr/496/0). Through the imaginative interpellations of speculative fiction, _(we)_ gravitate toward new localities and means of presence: ecological, technological, [Afro-futuristic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlPwTMMhGGI), (_[African-futuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanfuturism), [Chicana-futuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicanafuturism), and so on)_. Facing the imminent prospect of both disaster and discovery, they call us to resist despair and to craft tangible ways of shaping and repairing the worlds we still hope for.

## BACKGROUND

Just as [Sun Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra) used music to transcend time and space, in "[Space is the place](https://youtu.be/vHLOPBx2BaE)", our Sound Systems strive to diminish the distinction between sonic experiences and music as a means of intellectual exploration.  
  
Our goal is to embark on voyages to distant lands and spaces, akin to intrepid explorers of uncharted territories, and convey our discoveries through sonic experiences and performances aiming to unveil fresh interpretations and shed new light on our connection with the world.  
  
Drawing inspiration from [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin) and [Todd Barton](https://toddbarton.com/about/biography/)'s "[Music and Poetry of the Kesh](https://ursulakleguintoddbarton.bandcamp.com/album/music-and-poetry-of-the-kesh)," which served as a soundtrack for Le Guin's novel "[Always Coming Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_Coming_Home)," our endeavour involves envisioning, constructing, and theorising instruments and interfaces, as part of rituals that embody the values and concepts of the worlds they inhabit.

## BRIEF → AUTUMN 2023

This project presents an opportunity to explore design as a means of imaginative expression, enabling us to question and critique our existing modes of thinking and being while fostering new possibilities. In this context, design functions as an interface for both generating knowledge and conveying information.  
  
Our focus will be on crafting objects, instruments, and artefacts that produce sound, while taking careful consideration of how we engage with them — whether individually or collectively, through fast jerky movements or slow soft touches, whilst standing upright or laying down, at dawn or dusk, and so on. 

We will contemplate the ways in which we interact with these objects, their spatial arrangements, and their aesthetic and qualitative attributes, both in their sonic characteristics and materiality. All these aspects will be examined in relation to fictional socio-cultural contexts, that we will collectively dream, imagine and define, by departing from what is real to explore other and potentially new ideological projects.

Finally we will embody these new worlds through the making and crafting of rituals, events relative to these speculated spaces.

> (…) In the age of nth order simulacra the limited beings that we are may need to come to terms with the notion that fiction really exists and reality is unknowable as anything but, hopefully complex, fictions. Reductions of what is there to something we can narrativise. This means that the stakes are very high when you write something down but, paradoxically, this knowledge renders these stakes absurd.

## DELIVERABLES

This project will culminate in the creation of:
1.  A sound archive consisting of a series of audio tracks we will all produce.
2.  A short but "[thick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avW6g31hy-c&ab_channel=Then%26Now)" description of the ritual/event, in the form of a narrative piece of writing.
3.  A 5 minute performance of the ritual/event at Iklectik.
4.  A well considered photograph of the sound making items, objects, or artefacts.
